# Hangman-Project-
 Hangman is a guessing game where one player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess it by suggesting letters. The word is represented by dashes, and if the guessed letter is correct, it's filled in. Incorrect guesses result in drawing elements of a hangman diagram. The game ends when the word is completed or guessed correctly.
